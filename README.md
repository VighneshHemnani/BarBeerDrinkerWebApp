# BarBeerDrinkerWebApp

## Project description

BarBeerDrinker is a database creation and integration with a webapp project that is a part of a course at Rutgers University, CS336 taught by Professor Tomasz Imieli≈Ñski. In this project, we are given a large amount of data points on bars, beers and drinkers in a fictional town, to create a database with the appropriate tables and keys, and then link the database to a website that we made in HTML, CSS and JSP to provide insightful tables and graphs and allow a user to update or delete tuples from the database. 

## Database structure

One of the first steps of the project was to decide how the database was structured. In this step, we also had to take into account what the primary keys and foreign keys were. If you are interested in make these same tables in your database, you can have a look at <structure.pdf> that includes the creation table code in MySQL. These will also give you insight on which variables were decided as primary or foriegn keys. 

## How can I view this project?

1. You can view the .mp4 video demonstration of the webapp as well as the database in its entirety by going to the demo.mp4 OR
2. You can download and run the files as you like:

Software needed:

   - Tomcat (or any preferred alternative)  
   - A browser (Safari, Chrome etc.)  
   - Database Management Tool (like MySQL Workbench)  
   - IDE (like Eclipse)  

   To view this project, you would first need to recreate the tables in the database: using your preferred software, you can use the creation table code in  <strucutre.pdf> to create the empty tables. Then, you can import the sample data points that were provided to us so that way, you can view and run the code in the webapp. Then, once you have done that, you can download the webapp folder and run the index.jsp in your preferred IDE. Ensure that Tomcat is installed and working correctly, and then you can run the website on whichever browser you prefer.
